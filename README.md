This project studies data mining techniques from text data. More specifically, it deals with the problem of price prediction, treating it with supervised techniques as a regression problem. Based on the training data, we try to find a model suitable for rating the quality of an answer as an answer to a question (query). The problem is closely related to information retrieval techniques. We use TF-IDF for feature extraction and multiple metrics to evaluate the results.
